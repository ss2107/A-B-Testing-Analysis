Company XYZ is a worldwide e-commerce site with localized versions of the site.
A data scientist at XYZ noticed that Spain-based users have a much higher conversion rate than
any other Spanish-speaking country. She therefore went and talked to the international team in
charge of Spain And LatAm to see if they had any ideas about why that was happening.

Spain and LatAm country manager suggested that one reason could be translation. All Spanishspeaking
countries had the same translation of the site which was written by a Spaniard. They 
agreed to try a test where each country would have its one translation written by a local. That is,
Argentinian users would see a translation written by an Argentinian, Mexican users by a Mexican
and so on. Obviously, nothing would change for users from Spain.

After they run the test however, they are really surprised cause the test is negative. I.e., it
appears that the non-localized translation was doing better!

Goals:

1) Confirm that the test is actually negative. That is, it appears that the old version of the
site with just one translation across Spain and LatAm performs better

2) Explain why that might be happening. Are the localized translations really worse?
